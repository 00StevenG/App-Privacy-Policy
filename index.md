# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use our mobile applications (the “Apps”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using our Apps, you agree to the terms outlined here.

## Data Collection

### How Do We Collect Data?
Data may be collected through third-party partners such as Apple. We do not directly collect any data linked to the user’s identity unless explicitly stated.

### Data Collected from Third-Party Partners

Our Apps may include APIs from third parties. We recommend reviewing the terms and privacy policies of any third-party service before interacting with it. Third-party services we utilize to operate and manage our Apps may collect and provide us with data, such as:

- **Data from Platform Providers**: Operating systems like Apple’s iOS ([Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/))
- **Data for Analytics Purposes**: For example, Aptabase ([Privacy Policy](https://aptabase.com/legal/privacy))

## Audio

Some of our Apps may record audio for speech analysis purposes. Key points regarding audio data:

- **Purpose**: Audio is recorded and sent to a remote server solely for speech and phonetic language analysis. It is not saved locally on your device.
- **Storage**: Once analysis is complete, all audio data submitted by users is irreversibly deleted from remote servers.
- **Data on Device**: All language analysis results, such as scores and transcriptions, are stored on the device only and are not shared with third parties.

Our software runs on the Apple iOS operating system, which may impact your privacy:

- **Speech Recognition**: If you use iOS Speech Recognition, your speech data is transmitted to Apple over an encrypted connection. You can disable Speech Recognition by turning off "Dictation" in iOS.
- **Payments**: Our Apps may use Apple as a payment provider. Apple’s Privacy Policy applies to all transactions and can be found [here](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

## Usage Data

We collect certain information about your use of our Apps, such as features accessed, duration, and other usage statistics. This data helps us to:

- Provide and improve our Apps by analyzing features and functionality.
- Offer personalized feedback and recommendations based on speech and usage data.
- Monitor and analyze trends to enhance the overall user experience.
- Detect and address technical issues, security concerns, or illegal activities.

## Payment Information

We do not access your credit card or billing information directly, as transactions are managed by third-party partners like Apple.

## Platform Game Services

Some of our Apps use platform game services (e.g., Apple Game Center) to track non-personal data, such as leaderboard scores. These services may collect additional information, which we do not control. You may review Apple Game Center’s Privacy Policy [here](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

## Integration with Natural Language Processing Services

To enhance the functionality of our Apps, we integrate third-party natural language processing (NLP) services. This section outlines how we handle data related to this integration.

### Data Collection and Transmission

- **User Inputs**: When you use features that leverage NLP services, the text you provide is transmitted to third-party servers to generate appropriate responses.
- **Response Data**: The responses generated by these NLP services are then delivered back to you through our Apps.

### Data Usage

- **Purpose**: The data transmitted to NLP services is used solely to generate responses for your interactions within our Apps.
- **Model Training Opt-Out**: We have configured our NLP service integrations to disable the use of your data for training purposes. This means that your inputs and interactions are not used to improve or train the language models of the NLP service providers.

### Data Storage and Retention

- **Temporary Storage**: Data transmitted to NLP services is processed in real-time to generate responses and is not stored longer than necessary.
- **Deletion Policies**: Data is retained only for a limited period to ensure service functionality and security. Since we have disabled data usage for model training, your data is not used beyond immediate processing needs.
  

### Data Security

- **Encryption**: All data transmitted between our Apps and NLP services is encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect against unauthorized access.
- **Access Controls**: Access to data processed through these services is restricted to authorized personnel only, ensuring that your data remains secure.

### User Rights and Data Management

- **Access and Deletion**: You have the right to access, modify, or request deletion of your personal data. To exercise these rights, please refer to the "Your Rights" section below.
- **Anonymization**: Where possible, we anonymize your data before transmitting it to NLP services to further protect your privacy.

### Compliance with Data Protection Regulations

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Our integration with NLP services complies with major data protection regulations, including GDPR and CCPA. We ensure that all data handling practices meet the required legal standards to protect your personal information.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain statutory rights in relation to your Personal Information. For example, you may have the right to:

- Access your Personal Information and information relating to how it is processed.
- Delete your Personal Information from our records.
- Rectify or update your Personal Information.
- Transfer your Personal Information to a third party (right to data portability).
- Restrict how we process your Personal Information.
- Withdraw your consent—where we rely on consent as the legal basis for processing at any time.
- Object to how we process your Personal Information.
- Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

You can exercise some of these rights through your account settings within our Apps.

## Security and Retention

We implement commercially reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. While no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely secure, we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data.

We retain your Personal Information only as long as necessary to provide our Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Retention periods depend on factors such as the nature of the information, legal requirements, and business needs.

## Updates to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to comply with legal requirements or to reflect changes in our practices. The updated policy will be effective immediately upon posting or as required by law.
