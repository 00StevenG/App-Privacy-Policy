# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use our mobile applications (the “Apps”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using our Apps, you agree to the terms outlined here.

## Data Collection

### How Do We Collect Data?
Data may be collected through third-party partners such as Apple. We do not directly collect any data linked to the user’s identity unless explicitly stated.

### Data Collected from Third-Party Partners

Our Apps may include APIs from third parties. We recommend reviewing the terms and privacy policies of any third-party service before interacting with it. Third-party services we utilize to operate and manage our Apps may collect and provide us with data, such as:

- **Data from Platform Providers**: Operating systems like Apple’s iOS (Privacy Policy: [Apple](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/))
- **Data for Analytics Purposes**: For example, Aptabase ([Privacy Policy](https://aptabase.com/legal/privacy))

## Audio

Some of our Apps may record audio for speech analysis purposes. Key points regarding audio data:

- **Purpose**: Audio is recorded and sent to a remote server solely for speech and phonetic language analysis. It is not saved locally on your device.
- **Storage**: Once analysis is complete, all audio data submitted by users is irreversibly deleted from remote servers.
- **Data on Device**: All language analysis results, such as scores and transcriptions, are stored on the device only and are not shared with third parties.

Our software runs on the Apple iOS operating system, which may impact your privacy:

- **Speech Recognition**: If you use iOS Speech Recognition, your speech data is transmitted to Apple over an encrypted connection. You can disable Speech Recognition by turning off "Dictation" in iOS.
- **Payments**: Our Apps may use Apple as a payment provider. Apple’s Privacy Policy applies to all transactions and can be found [here](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

## Usage Data

We collect certain information about your use of our Apps, such as features accessed, duration, and other usage statistics. This data helps us to:

- Provide and improve our Apps by analyzing features and functionality.
- Offer personalized feedback and recommendations based on speech and usage data.
- Monitor and analyze trends to enhance the overall user experience.
- Detect and address technical issues, security concerns, or illegal activities.

## Payment Information

We do not access your credit card or billing information directly, as transactions are managed by third-party partners like Apple.

## Platform Game Services

Some of our Apps use platform game services (e.g., Apple Game Center) to track non-personal data, such as leaderboard scores. These services may collect additional information, which we do not control. You may review Apple Game Center’s Privacy Policy [here](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

## Updates to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to comply with legal requirements or to reflect changes in our practices. The updated policy will be effective immediately upon posting or as required by law.
